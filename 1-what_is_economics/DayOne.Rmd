## Plan for the Day

+ Walk through the syllabus

## Syllabus

You can find the syllabus here. (https://github.com/woodsjam/Course-Intro-Macroeconomics/blob/master/SyllabusEC202Woods.pdf
)

Almost all the slides will also be on github. (https://github.com/woodsjam/Course-Intro-Macroeconomics)

+ Download them before each class if you like, but they are not a substitute for coming to class.


## Intro Macro (Official)

## Intro Macro (Unofficial)

+ Talk many of you out of a business degree.
+ Convince you that economics is not **just** about money or markets
+ Make the news and politicians funnier.
+ Talk some of you into being econ majors.

Exams will be given on those days and at those times only.  I do not give make up, early or late exams. Get those on your calendars.  Make sure you are not scheduled to work or deciding to fly somewhere.

DRC People:  Schedule time slots in testing center so that you start at the same time as the rest of class.

## Contact Information

+ My office is in CH 241-O.
+ Drop in office hours are Monday 12:00-1:00  through the last week of class. There is no need to make an appointment for these hours -- just come.
+ If you can’t attend regular office hours, please check my calendar https://woodsj.youcanbook.me/. I will make a limited number of 15 minute slots available each week. If you make an appointment and fail to show up without first canceling, I will penalize your final exam score two points.  

My in-person office hours may need to be moved to a different location because of construction in Cramer Hall.  

Meetings can be via phone or even the hangout/meet function in your pdx.edu email.

I will also keep Slack up during office hours to answer questions.

## Slack

I avoid email since it is a trash heap and a constant distraction.

+ The class will use slack https://PSUec202Fall2018.slack.com
+ Handles direct messages, forum style responses.
+ You should be able to sign up with your pdx.edu account
+ Can access via webpage, apps in Android and iOS.
+ Linked in d2l.
+ Officially supported PSU software
+ Common in industry
+ Many of you already use it.

## Hints on Slack

+ Prefer #general to direct messaging me.
    + Questions about course material is for #general
    + Questions about your grade or anything private is for @jamie woods
+ "I can't find it anywhere" is usually answered with:
    + A link to a google search.
+ Don't start and end with, "I got 7 but the key shows 245.  What did I do wrong?"
    + Show your work.  The fix is often a single parameter.
+ Provide full text of the question you are working on.

In short, make it easy for someone to help you.

## More Slack Hints

+ Rants and bellyaching put you at the bottom of the queue or off the queue.
+ Night before the exam?  You are on your own.
+ Set personal Do Not Disturb times.  It it defaults to 10pm -8am


## Textbook 

Krugman, Paul R., and Robin Wells. Macroeconomics ed. 5., Worth Publishers, 2018.(ISBN-10: 1-319-09875-4).  

+ This textbook is amazingly overpriced.
+ Will not be assigning questions out of the book.
+ Hint: You can rent an earlier edition for  under $20 just make it line up with the 5th edition readings.

## Exams

+ Closed book, notes, internet, friend, etc.
+ Mostly multiple choice but not, "what is the definition of .." style.
+ Seating chart

+ Bags, phones, smart watches at the side or front of room.
+ Many versions of the exam.
 
## In-class quizzes

+ Could be one each class

+ Key provided


## Homework

+ At most weekly.
+ Turned in via D2L either as a D2L "quiz", or as a pdf or word document through D2L "assignment" function. 
+ Do not write the assignments out by hand and then turn in a photo in pdf form.


## D2L

I will assume you know how  to work D2L. 

+ Calendar on left
+ Links in the middle
+ Content, Quizzes and Grades up top

## D2L Key Takeaways

+ Homework is either an "assignment" or a "quiz" depending on if the homework is written or multiple choice.
+ Both show in the calendar
+ Typically due Friday at noon.
+ At least a week notice

## Assessments and Grade Policy

+ Final Exam (30%)
+ Midterm 1 (20%)
+ Midterm 2 (20%)
+ In-class quizzes (20%)
+ Homework (10%)

## Econ Break

We will look at these in greater detail later.

+ Principle #1: Choices are necessary because resources are scarce. 
+ Principle #2: The true cost of something is its opportunity cost. 
+ Principle #3: “How much” is a decision at the margin. 
+ Principle #4: People usually respond to incentives, exploiting opportunities to make themselves better off. 

Why did I allocate grades the way I did?

## Why from My POV?

+ Principle #1: Choices are necessary because resources are scarce. 
    + Had to add up to 100%
    + Only so much time I can grade.
+ Principle #2: The true cost of something is its opportunity cost. 
    + Focus on higher quality, in-class, information.
    + Making sure I am giving **you** the grade and not someone else.
+ Principle #3: “How much” is a decision at the margin. 
    + More on homework would mean less on exams or quizzes.
    + Balanced to achieve my objective -- you knowing things and being able to do things.
+ Principle #4: People usually respond to incentives, exploiting opportunities to make themselves better off. 
    + I am manipulating you.
    + What am I trying to get you to do?

## Do your Own Work

+ A few facts on scale. https://www.plagiarism.org/article/plagiarism-facts-and-stats

+ How easy is it to outsource your class? https://www.google.com/search?q=take+my+online+class+for+me&rlz=1C1GGRV_enUS751US753&oq=take+my+online+class+for+me&aqs=chrome..69i57.4986j0j4&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8

## Stop Procrastinating

+ Plenty of studies show that at least 2/3rds of you procrastinate.
+ Regular interaction, to create habit, is supposed to help.

http://success.oregonstate.edu/learning/stop-procrastinating

## What am I trying to get you to do?

+ Come to class.
+ Do your own work.
+ Work with the material regularly -- several times a week -- so you don't procrastinate.

## Bonus Question

Principle #2: The true cost of something is its opportunity cost.

+ Final Exam (30%)
+ Midterm 1 (20%)
+ Midterm 2 (20%)
+ In-class quizzes (20%)
+ Homework (10%)

So ...

+ What is most important?
+ Do the 'points' fully describe the opportunity cost?

## Looks like the Final but it isn't

+ What is the opportunity cost of not coming to class?
    + Can't take the quiz
    + You only get the slide version of the lecture, not the full version.
    + Do you think you can do well on the homework and exams without attending class?
  
  
The most expensive part of a meal is not always the best part. Price, the financial part, does not always indicate quality.

## So about you business majors

"With a five-year 31% underemployment rate according to Burning Glass, and a massive 601,092 degrees passed out in 2016, business and related majors produced a staggering 186,339 people with a degree and no corresponding college-level job. Counting the initial underemployment rate for business and related majors of 47%, a whopping 282,513 were underemployed in 2016."
