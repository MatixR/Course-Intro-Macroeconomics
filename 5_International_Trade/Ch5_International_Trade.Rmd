## We Talked A Little About Trade   

We talked about the basis for trade, differences in opportunity costs, but we need to expand on that idea.


Rough Outline:

How compartive advantage
  Difference in factor endowments 
  Heckscherâ€“Ohlin theorem (Does not perform well acccross countries but does within.)
  Rybczynski Theorm says if you get more of an input you will have a more than porportional increase in production of good that uses that input.
  But, Stolper-Samuelson says that goods prices drives factor prices.
  Factor Price equalization theorm says that even without factor mobility, factor prices will equalize. (But only seems to hold when the countries are similar)
  
  
  Make supply and demand  graphs side by side, world vs domestic market.  
  
  If world lower, import.  If world higher, export.
